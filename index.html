    <header id="about">About Me</header>
<p>My life has consisted of hospitals and life lessons. From the time I was born, I always had health issues. From the many surgeries to taking 11 different daily medications, I've learned to power through and cheat death for as long as I can. I was told I couldn't do much so I basically changed it from can't do "this or that", to I CAN do other things. I was told I couldn't teach, go into the medical field, and I can't have a physically demanding job. So I changed it to I CAN learn to code! Even though I've been through some tough obstacles, I'm still here. From brain surgery that left me perminent damage, to my brother's passing on my birthday in 2023, I've truly learned that "Life doesn't allow you to be weak". Which is a constant reminder now that I have it tattooed on me :). </p>
